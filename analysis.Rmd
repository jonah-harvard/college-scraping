    return(professors_list[n] %>% as_tibble() %>% pull(1) %>% mutate(college = college_name))

    return(
        tibble(

          rating = c(NA_integer_),

for (ind in 1:length(professors_list)) {
  if (!is.null(nth_prof(ind))) {

# Relationships

```{r graphing, warning=FALSE}
professors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(difficulty, rating)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Rating as a Function of Difficulty",
    x = "Difficulty",
    y = "Rating"
  ) + 
  theme_classic()
```

The initial graphing of the data doesn't seem to convey much. By all appearances, there could be very little correlation between difficulty and rating.

```{r graphing_by_college}
professors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(difficulty, rating, color = department)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  
  # Use geom_smooth to accentuate the relationship between variables
  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = college)) +
  labs(
    title = "Rating as a Function of Difficulty by College",
    x = "Difficulty",
    y = "Rating"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  facet_wrap(~college) 
```

When faceting by college, however, it becomes a lot clearer that there is, in fact, a negative correlation between difficulty and rating.


```{r graphing_by_department}
professors %>% 
  ggplot(aes(difficulty, rating, color = college)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  
  # Use geom_smooth to accentuate the relationship between variables
  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = department)) +
  labs(
    title = "Rating as a Function of Difficulty by College",
    x = "Difficulty",
    y = "Rating"
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 5)
  )+
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  facet_wrap(~department) 
```

# Distributions

```{r distributions, message=FALSE}

# histogram_of_college is a simple function for looking at the data
# associated with a particular college.

histogram_of_college <- function(college_name) {
  college_data <- professors %>% filter(college == college_name)
  print(cor.test(college_data$difficulty, college_data$rating))
  college_data %>% ggplot(aes(rating)) + geom_histogram()
}

professors %>% ggplot(aes(rating)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Rating by College") #+ facet_wrap(~ college)
professors %>% ggplot(aes(difficulty)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Difficulty by College") #+ facet_wrap(~ college)
```


When looking at the distribution of difficulties, as one might expect, the data seems more or less normally distributed, with mean 3. On the other hand, however, ratings are skewed strongly to the left.



```{r salary_data}
salaries <- salaries %>% mutate(
  school_name = map_chr(school_name, ~str_remove(., " \\(\\w*\\)")),
  starting_median_salary = map_dbl(starting_median_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]"))),
  mid_career_median_salary = map_dbl(mid_career_median_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]"))),
  mid_career_10th_percentile_salary = map_dbl(mid_career_10th_percentile_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]"))),
  mid_career_25th_percentile_salary = map_dbl(mid_career_25th_percentile_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]"))),
  mid_career_75th_percentile_salary = map_dbl(mid_career_75th_percentile_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]"))),
  mid_career_90th_percentile_salary = map_dbl(mid_career_90th_percentile_salary, ~ as.numeric(str_remove_all(., "[$,]")))
)
professors %>% inner_join(salaries, by=c("college" = "school_name")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(difficulty, rating, color = starting_median_salary)) + geom_point()
```

There is no obvious correlation between the salary data and rating data so far.


```{r salary_facet_wrap}
professors %>% inner_join(salaries, by=c("college" = "school_name")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(difficulty, rating, color = starting_median_salary)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~starting_median_salary)
```

Even as we facet wrap, no clear relationship between starting median salary of graduates and ratings vs. difficulty jumps out.
