# About the Project

In this project, I explore how professor ratings correlate with their difficulty and with the median starting salary of graduates of their respective colleges. Before beginning analysis, I hypothesized that ratings would correlate negatively with difficulty, and positively with median starting salary. The reasoning behind these hypotheses was that I thought students wouldn't like to be put in a position where they thought the professor was too challenging, so difficulty would bring down the professor's rating, and that colleges with a high median starting salary for graduates would have good professors which would bring up the rating.

I wrote a [python script](https://github.com/jonah-harvard/college-scraping/blob/master/scrape_rate_my_professor.py)
that I use to collect professor rating data from [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/). It also collects professors' difficulty score and department. Some thought should be put in to whether the ratings are truly representative of the general student opinion of these teachers and readers should just keep in mind that all we know are ratings as reported on Rate My Professor. Due to limitations of time and using my local machine for scraping, I have had to work with a small subset of colleges. If I were to repeat or expand this analysis, I would work with more colleges, and select them more randomly. At the moment, the colleges are overwhelmingly focused in New England. 

The data on median salaries after graduation comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) and was released by the Wall Street Journal, a reasonably trustworthy source.

All the code for data collection and analysis can be found on my academic [github](https://github.com/jonah-harvard/college-scraping).
